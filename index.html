    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is Kasia and I live in Krak√≥w, Poland. I have decided to start learning programming almost a year ago. I love that in programming you combine creativity and logic thinking 
      to solve problems. I'm currently learning at Codecool to become a fullstack developer. My preferred language is C#, but I don't mind digging in frontend too. </p>
